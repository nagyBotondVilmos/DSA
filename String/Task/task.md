# Head to head
Charlie and Benjamin are brothers. They both love programming. One day they had to do a Linux homework assignment, and they had to solve the task using the "grep" command. The brothers immediately started working on it, but they both ran into the same obstacle: They couldn't find the grep command in Bash, and they didn't know what to do. Since both of them are quite skilled in coding, they came up with a plan. They decided to write their own grep using C++. Although they are brothers, there is a competitive spirit between them, and they both strive for the extra point. Since you know that Beni is lazy and won't spend much time optimizing, you decide that you will be faster than your brother, Benjamin.

# Requirement
Implement "grep" so that it finds occurrences of the pattern faster than a naive algorithm!

# Input
Read the pattern and the file name from the console.

# Output
Count how many times the pattern appears in the specified file and where.

# Constraints
The pattern can only contain lowercase and uppercase letters of the English alphabet.

# Example
- Input
`input.txt` - (input.txt content: "kamkamcksmksmkm")
`ksm` - pattern to search for

- Output
2
7 10

# Maximum execution time: 1 second
